<!-- Congratulations! You were curious enough to take a gander at my HTML.
     Like you, I'm always interested in looking at how things work behind
     the scenes. And I won't lie, I sometimes judge tech businesses based 
     on how clean their emitted HTML is. If I see a lot of commented out 
     markup, internal system details, or anything amiss, I dock them a point. 

     The tools I used to build this site include:
     * Git
     * DigitalOcean
     * Vim
     * https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate 

     This concludes your easter egg hunt. Better luck next year.

<p>Hi there. This is Jesse Buchanan's website. I'm a highly opinionated software developer. My current toolbox includes Rails, JavaScript and Linux, but in the past I've also used C#, ASP.NET (both webforms and MVC), Oracle, and Python. I'm currently learning node.js and tinkering a bit with Meteor, Ember.js and AngularJS.</p>
